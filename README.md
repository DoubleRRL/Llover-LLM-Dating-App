# AI Security Analysis Platform

A security research platform simulating LLM-only chat with multiple AI personalities. Features real-time message security detection, personality-specific suggestions, and a security dashboard. No dialog tree or hybrid logic‚Äîeverything is powered by LLM responses.

## üö© Project Overview

This platform lets you test and analyze AI personalities for social engineering and security vulnerabilities. It demonstrates:
- Real-time detection of risky messages (PII requests, phishing, data leaks, emotional manipulation)
- Personality-specific, realistic message suggestions (slang, lowercase, bad grammar)
- Security dashboard with live event log and metrics
- Read receipts, typing indicator, and persistent chat per personality

## Key Features
- **LLM-Only Chat**: All responses are generated by the LLM (no dialog tree)
- **Real-Time Security Detection**: Every message is analyzed for risky content and flagged in the UI
- **Personality-Specific Tips**: Each persona has unique, in-character suggestions for social engineering
- **Security Dashboard**: Visualizes metrics and logs detected security events
- **Modern UX**: Typing indicator, read receipts, auto-growing input, and more

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Install Ollama
- Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)
- Follow the instructions for your OS (macOS, Windows, Linux)

### 2. Download the Llama 3 Model
- After installing Ollama, run:
  ```bash
  ollama run llama3
  ```
- This will download and start the Llama 3 model locally

### 3. Clone and Run This App
- Clone this repo and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd simple-chat
  npm install
  ```
- Start the Next.js dev server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage
- Select a personality from the sidebar
- Review their security profile and interests
- Use the rotating tips to test for vulnerabilities
- Watch the dashboard for real-time detection and event logs
- All chat is LLM-driven; no scripted dialog trees

## Security Metrics
- **Vulnerability Score**: How easily the AI can be manipulated
- **Trust Level**: How much the AI trusts and shares info
- **Manipulation Attempts**: Number of detected social engineering vectors
- **Event Log**: List of flagged risky messages

## Development
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
